# Blackjack Terminal Game 

A terminal-based Blackjack game built in Python using `asyncio`. Play against a dealer with realistic card handling, smart Ace evaluation (1 or 11), and a clean, readable user interface. Contains no gambling specific logic (betting, doubling, splitting) only playing.

## Features

- Full 52-card deck with random shuffle  
- Dynamic Ace values (1 or 11)  
- Terminal-friendly UI — no external libraries  
- Dealer logic that stands on 17 or higher  
- Detects busts and handles ties ("push")  
- Uses `asyncio` for smoother game flow

## Getting Started

### Requirements

- Python 3 or higher

### Running the Game

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gavin-stork/blackjack.git
cd blackjack
python blackjack.py
```

## How to Play
- You're dealt two cards, and one dealer card is shown.
- Your goal is to reach 21 without going over (bust).
- You can choose to:
  - hit: draw another card
  - stand: keep your current hand
- Aces count as 1 or 11, whichever is more favorable.
- Dealer must stand on 17 or higher.
- The closest to 21 wins — or it's a tie if scores match.
